#1	AnnotatorNotes T4	You should try to understand that if refugees are welcome it is because they are not taking anyone's place from housing and NHS. If there is lacking on these things is because of other reasons. In any case, you should blame the powerfuls, not the desperate people escaping from war and poverty

#2	AnnotatorNotes T5	Do you really think that if people can't access to housing or proper healthcare is because of immigrants? I really don't think so. You should demand politicians to invest more on houses and healthcare, not blame the helpless
