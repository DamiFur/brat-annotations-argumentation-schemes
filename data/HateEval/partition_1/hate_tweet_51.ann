#1	AnnotatorNotes T12	You seem to measure everything according to refugees and immigrants. Your xenophobia blocks you from addressing real society problems and you blame immigrants for anything and everything

#2	AnnotatorNotes T13	Suggesting that crime rates go up and resources are lower because immigration is just not true. Immigrants paytaxes and most of them are not criminals but hard working people trying to improve their familie's lives

#3	AnnotatorNotes T14	Do you have any proof that Sweeden crime rate increased because of immigration? or that UK is spending too much resources on them? Or that France is cracking down on immigration? I think it's just xenophobic lies
