#1	AnnotatorNotes T3	Many things are a disaster, but the link between high taxes and refugees you speak of does not exist.

#2	AnnotatorNotes T4	You claim it's a sad story because you don't like refugees. The problem, is that you are trying to convince us that it is "a disaster", when it clearly is not.
